    "Text": "Bluefin is not just software, she is a new breed of animal, adapted to survive the rigors of an ecosystem dominated by giants while protecting her family. \n\nWe believe that the desktop experience needs to change. Technology begins with the local computer, the device that you touch, and it should be as essential as the rest of the Linux ecosystem.\n\nBy introducing cloud-native patterns to the desktop we hope to ignite interest in desktop computing while catering to the next generation of open-source contributors. Bluefin is designed to be the tool you depend on to do what you do best. The current Linux desktop didn't get us there, but we believe that what was made, can be unmade. Let's make it better.\n\nBluefin is about sustainability, encompassing the software, the hardware, and the people.\n\n> There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.\n> <cite>[Edith Wharton][1]</cite>\n\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Wharton\n\nOr she may disembowel us on the way.

        "question": "What is this exactly? Why did you make a Linux distribution?",
        "answer": "Bluefin utilizes bootc's OCI container features to compose and build an OS image. This process is overseen by a well-structured community that is committed to automation and sustainability. The end result is akin to a configuration management tool like Ansible or Salt, but without the typical challenges associated with maintaining a custom distribution. We use the term \"custom image\" to describe this approach. It's like having someone install, configure, and maintain a polished setup for you. \n\n It's akin to your geeky friend helping you set up your computer, except we do it together as a community to help each other. \n\n[OSTree Native Containers](https://containers.github.io/bootc/)"

        "question": "How does this differ from other desktops?",
        "answer": "Bluefin is a next generation desktop that purposely behaves like a consumer device instead of a traditional distribution. We remove choice paralysis for users by presenting one well curated Flathub store, Homebrew, and minimize the use of system packaging. \n\n For developers we concentrate on a pure cloud-native developer workflow via devcontainers.  \n\nOr use any OCI container as your user space. \n\n [Distrobox](https://distrobox.privatedns.org/compatibility/#host-distros) \n [Flathub](https://flathub.org) \n [Devcontainers](https://containers.dev) \n [Ptyxis](https://flathub.org/apps/app.devsuite.Ptyxis)"

        "question": "Why dinosaurs?",
        "answer": "Bluefin is a Deinonychus antirrhopus, a theropod dinosaur whose name means \"terrible claw\". Discovered in the 1960s, she revolutionized our understanding of dinosaurs. Before Deinonychus, dinosaurs were often seen as slow, dim-witted creatures. However, she shattered these misconceptions, offering insight into the dynamic world of hot-blooded, rapidly evolving animals that were masters of their domain. We aim for our desktop to embody a similar nimbleness. Power and adaptability. \n\n [Deinonychus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinonychus)"

        "question": "How do you plan on making the project sustainable?",
        "answer": "The project is purposely written in bash and Python in order to allow easy entry. We are just copying files around, it's Linux. Since this model scales, we feel that organizations that get value from this project would contribute some of their time to helping maintain it. It's mostly feature complete and it attracts automation minded system administrators. Any one can contribute and get value back by automating operating system maintenance via a community. Or just donate to GitHub Sponsors to help pay for the builders and to sponsor more paleoart. \n\n [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/castrojo)"

Also check out Bazzite if you want an enthusiast-grade gaming experience, similar to SteamOS.

It represents the delicate balance of life and is there to remind us that open source is an ecosystem that needs to be sustained.
